Welcome aboard {{first_name}}!

Your membership application has been approved! 

There are a couple of things to pay attention to next. 

First of all, it is time to login to {{siteurl}} and check your payment information and status.

If you would like to meet community members face to face as much as we would like to meet you, please join us in the weekly open house or the monthly community meeting. Please check the local dates on our web site.

It is also highly recommended to join our communication channels. We use Matrix, and you can connect by different apps -read the instructions, and if you haven't yet, the whole membership guide in {{wikiurl}}

{{ss.service.name}}

{% if ss.service.access_phone_number %}
{% trans 'Door opening number' %}: {{ss.service.access_phone_number}}
{% endif %}
{% endfor %}

Important note about door access! The payment data from bank is synced only every two weeks or so and this might
mean that your payment is not seen by the system until the next sync happens. You can check when the last sync happened in {{siteurl}}

All Hacklab services work by voluntary basis so
things might not always work. Please be patient. For the
challenges help would be appreciated, and we would be more than
happy for your contribution.

Welcome!
